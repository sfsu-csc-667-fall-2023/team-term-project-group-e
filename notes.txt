games

clients send post request --> api sends 200 back (basically ignore response) --> asynchronously update game state over websocket (to keep everyone in sync)
server single source of truth for the state of the game.

client -----> game ------> sent to everyone else

we are currently hiding the game socket in an input field that is hidden

note: get user socket from user.getusersocket, game socket from getgame
